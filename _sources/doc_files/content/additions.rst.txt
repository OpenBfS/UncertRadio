Additional Notes
----------------

File Selection Dialog
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: /images/open_dialog.png
    :align: center

Note: If this dialog is used in the mode "\ **save as**\ ", *the desired
file extension of the file name must explicitly be given or edited in
the name field (at the top of the dialog).* Only the pure filename has
to be inserted into this field, the desired path name is selected in the
dialog elements below.

Clicking on "**Recently used**" shows a list of recently used files.
The filenames are hold by the **RecentManager** of GTK; the latter works
with a file "recently-used.xbel", which e.g. for Windows is found in the
folder "**c:\\users\\[user]\\AppData\\Local\\**" (for the actual path name,
replace "[user]" with the correct username).

Input to tables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The input of a value into a cell of a table has to be finalized with the
enter key.

Column blocks in tables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Column blocks can no longer be selected with UR tables, i.e. the export
of such blocks to e.g. Excel is not possible. However, the reverse way
is possible: the import of a column block taken from e.g. an Excel file,
or from the text editor Notepad ++, into a column block of equal size in
an UR table; see also :numref:`within tables: delete rows, working with column blocks`.

For selecting a whole row click into the right part of a cell in this
row.
