This is a special example demonstrating how by the Monte Carlo method ("propagation of distribtions") a non-gaussian shape of the output quantity is revealed. It is the Example 1 taken from:

  WÃ¼bbeler, G., Krystek, M., Elster, C., 2008. Evaluation of measurement uncertainty and its 
  numerical calculation by a Monte Carlo method. Meas.Sci. Technol. 19, 084009 (4pp)

The graph resulting from UncertRadio's MC method should be compared with Fig. 4 in that paper.

As the example it is not from the field of maesauring activity decision and detection limit do not exist; therefore, simply symbols x1 and x2 are selected as net and gross counting rates, the field for the uncertainty formula of the gross count rate is left empty; two associated warning dialogs appear which ony simply accept.
