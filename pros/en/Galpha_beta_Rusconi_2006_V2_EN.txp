This example is dealing with gross alpha and gross beta activity determination using low-level
LSC measurements. It is taken from:

  R. Rusconi, M. Forte. M.Caresana, S. Bellinzona, M.T. Cazzaniga, G. Sgorbati, 2006. The
  evaluation of uncertainty in low-level LSC measurements of water samples. Appl. Radiat.
  Isot. 64, 1124-1129.

The paper describes how to determine the gross alpha and beta activity concentrations in water samples, Aa and Ab, respectivley, by applying alpha/beta pulseshape discrimination and using two counting windows (alpha and beta channel). For the gross alpha case it contains also an uncertainty budget which allows comparison with the UncertRadio results.

For UncertRadio the example has been set up as a case with two output quantities, Aalpha and Abeta, respectively.

Only for the purpose of calcualting the Detection threshold and the Detection limit the user has to select the variables (symbols) representing the net and gross counting rates, for each of the two output quantities:

Rneta and Rgrossa, if Aalpha is selected as active output quantity,
Rnetb and Rgrossb, if Abeta is selected as active output quantity.

Comment: For Aalpha, a combined standard uncertainty of 8.4 Bq/g (3.9 %) was given in Table 1; however, from the last column of that table a value of 7.95 Bq/g (3.7 %) may easily be calculated "by hand". The combined standard uncertainty obtained with UncertRadio is 7.99 Bq/g (3.7 %).

(2008-12-22)
2021-08-08: changed Q to get the unit of kg; for epsa and epsb, the unit 1/Bq/s was added. The result unit is now in Bq/kg.
@Formeltext:
Aalpha = Rneta * wa
Abeta = Rnetb * wb
wa = 1 / ( (1 - taua - taub) * epsa *Q )
wb = 1 / ( (1 - taua - taub) * epsb *Q )
Rneta = (Rgrossa - Rbacka) * (1 - taub) - Rnetba
Rnetba = (Rgrossb - Rbackb) * taub
Rnetb = (Rgrossb - Rbackb) * (1 - taua)  - Rnetbb
Rnetbb = (Rgrossa - Rbacka) * taua
Rgrossa = CGa / T
Rbacka = CBa / T
Rgrossb = CGb / T
Rbackb = CBb / T
