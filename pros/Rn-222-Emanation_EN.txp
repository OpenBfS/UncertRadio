Demonstration of a "negative linear" measurement model for the example of measuring the Radon-222 emanation of a Ra-226 source. In such a model the output quantity, the emanation coefficient, does not increase with the value of the gross quantity but decreases.

After establishment of a Rn-222/Ra-226 equlibrium in the Ra-226 source the activity of the Rn-222 still existing in the that source is measured indirectly as activity of its daughter Bi-214. The Ra-226 activity of the source is treated here as being already known. The emanation coefficient F is defined as:

    F = 1 - A(Pb214)/A(Ra226)

with A(Pb214) = (Rg214 - RT214)/(eps214*pg214). Herein, F and Rg214 are treated as net count rate and gross countrate, respecively. With the factor

    c = 1 / (A(Ra226)*eps214*pg214)

F may be expressed as follows:

    F = [1 + RT214*c] - Rg214*c ;         this corresponds to:      Rnet  = B - Rg214*c

In this expression the term in the aquare brackets, B, represents the total "background" and Rg214 (which is still a count rate) the gross quantity.

For apllying this in UR2, the output quantity y is defined by introducing a fictive calibration factor w:

    y = w * F

The calculations with UR2 can also be done with leaving out this (first) equation (F then is the output quantity).

NOTE: With applying a second Ra-226 source (calibration) this procedure can be improved (see  Linzmaier and RÃ¶ttger, Development of a low-level radon reference atmosphere, ARI 81 (2013) 208-211 )


(2017-09-18)
2021-08-17: The (empty) unit of eps214 was replaced by 1/Bq/s; this results in the unit s for the quantity c.
