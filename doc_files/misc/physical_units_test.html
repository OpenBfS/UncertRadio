<p>Within equations for calculating the value of an output quantity, the
input quantities are fully described by a value and by a unit.
Sometimes, it is not fully considered that instead of basic units (such
as kg, m, s) derived units (such as g, cm, min) are used. For
calculating the output quantity value correctly, with a combination of
basic units as its unit, scale factors for derived units have to be
inserted in the equations. There are two concepts supporting this within
UncertRadio:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Application of Trigger variables used to explicitly introduce unit
scaling factors in equations; the reader is referred to section
7.21.5. The scope of application of such triggers normally is wider
than its use for scale factors.</p></li>
<li><p>One can try to derive the unit of a dependent quantity from the units
of its input quantities by computations. This method can be used
within UncertRadio, at present mainly designed as a testing option
for a project. The more detailed description of such a method is the
main purpose of this section.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the aim is to correctly define for a project the number
values and units of its input quantities. This also includes the use of
derived units. It should then be possible for the program, to derive the
unit of the output quantity, with including the conversion to basic
units of the output quantity.</p>
<p>For successfully going this way, it is necessary to put more value on a
systematized application of units and their notation in text editors.
Therefore, it is <strong>important to describe units of input quantities most
completely</strong>. To arrive, for instance, in the example for measuring an
activity, at the unit “Bq” as a part of the output quantity’s unit, the
following is especially important:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Don’t leave the unit field of a detection efficiency empty, but use
the unit string “1/Bq/s“;</p></li>
<li><p>Apply a unit like “Bq*s/kg” for a calibration factor;</p></li>
<li><p>For a chemical yield, if determined by weighing, the unit strings
“g/g“ or “g/kg“ may apply.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Missing units of input quantities may prevent from calculating the
output quantity unit correctly.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this automated way of calculating units is
not compatible with applying trigger variables for scaling factors.</p>

<p>It is necessary to differentiate between basic units and derived units.
For evaluating an UncertRadio project, the aim is to replace derived
units by their basic units. Such a conversion requires to apply an
associated conversion factor to values und uncertainties of the
quantities.</p>

<p>The scaling factor associated with a counting duration is used (by
inversion) for a count rate variable <em>R</em> and, in most cases, this factor
is the same for <em>R</em> and for <em>u</em>(<em>R</em>), as long as the Poisson
statistics is applicable. An exception is given by the gross count rate
discussed in chapter 6.10, which is the sum of a binomial and a Poisson
distributed quantity. For a calibration factor <em>w</em> or <em>phi</em>, which can
be treated as a generalized product, the scaling factors for <em>w</em> or
<em>phi</em> and for <em>u</em>(<em>w</em>) or <em>u</em>(<em>phi</em>) are the same.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">5.21.2. </span>Explaining the calculation of units of dependent quantities<a class="headerlink" href="#explaining-the-calculation-of-units-of-dependent-quantities" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>For a dependent quantity the procedure is based on its equation given to
UncertRadio. The right-hand side of this equation is an arithmetic
expression (formula) of variable names. For calculating a unit, in a
first step, the variable names are replaced by unit names as strings; a
variable name “eps“ for a detection probability, e.g., is replaced by
“(1/eps/s)“; the brackets shall assure that this expression, after
insertion into the equation, is treated algebraically correct. In a
later step, the unit parts contained in it, “Bq“ and “s“, are replaced
by the characteristic numerical values “11“ and “21“ given in column B
of the file unitsTable.csv.</p>
<p>Before basic units can used for calculations, the following
modifications remain to be applied:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the right-hand side of an equation with the number <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> consists
of some quantities numbered by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>; the unit of the quantity
with number <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> can consist of one or more unit parts. The
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>-th quantity has an index or address <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(nng(k)\)</span> within
the completed symbol table within UR.</p></li>
<li><p>outside of arguments of function, all minus characters are replaced
by plus characters; this shall assure that in case of a simple net
count rate the difference of the unit values shall not become zero.</p></li>
<li><p>For functions used inside a formula, like Log(), Exp() and Sqrt(),
the variable names inside their arguments are replaced by unit names
and later by their characteristic unit values. In this was, the
argument of such a function gets a form which can be calculated
numerically. For this purpose, a <strong>second, simpler function parser is
used UncertRadio, called seval</strong>, which can calculate the formula
string, if containing only numbers, directly, it does not operate on
variables.</p></li>
<li><p>If the argument of Log() (mostly 2) does not contain a variable with
non-empty unit, i.e., a number, the expression Log(Argument) is set
equal to 1.</p></li>
<li><p>The unit of an input quantity with number <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> can contain more
than one unit parts, such that the unit represents a small formula.
For a detection probability <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(eps\)</span>, the unit could be 1/mBq/min.
The unit parts are converted to basic units and the associated
conversion factors are combined in the same way to build the
conversion of this input quantity: in the example, the scaling factor
of the combined unit is:
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(uconv\left( nng(k \right)) = 1/0,001/60\  = \ 16,66667\)</span>, if
the desired unit shall be 1/Bq/s.</p></li>
<li><p>To enable calculation, a unit string is build, for the example
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(eps\)</span>, from the characteristic unit values (see
unitsTable.csv): “(1/11.0/21.0)“.</p></li>
<li><p>Within an equation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> (for a dependent quantity) every single
variable name contained in it (number <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>) is replaced by such
a string. The scaling factor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(uconv(i)\)</span> for the quantity
associated with equation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> is determined from:</p></li>
</ul>

<span class="eqno">(5.21.1)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-physical-units-test-eq1" title="Link to this equation">¶</a></span>\[uconv(i) = seval(strgv1)/seval(strgv3)\]</div>
<p>Herein, the string <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(strgv1\)</span> is the formula string of equation
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span>, in which the names of the symbols <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> are replaced by
the product <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(uconv\left( nng(k) \right) \cdot Messwert(nng(k)\)</span>
converted to a string; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(strgv3\)</span> is the formula string of equation
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span>, in which the names of the symbols <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> are replace by
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Messwert(nng(k))\)</span> converted to a string.</p>
<p>Note: Messwert() denotes the array of measurement values (called MVals() in this test).</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It is assumed that the argument of an Exp function contains only
quantities like a decay constant <em>lambda</em> (1/s) and a counting
duration <em>t</em> (s). It is then allowed for this argument, that besides
the characteristic unit values also scaling factors of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(60^{\pm 1}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(60^{\pm 2}\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(86400^{\pm 1}\)</span> and
at the same time also associated factors like <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(60^{0}\)</span>, build
from Trigger variables, may occur. If then the overall argument value
is not an integer value and is not equal to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(60^{\pm 1}\)</span>,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(60^{\pm 2}\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(86400^{\pm 1}\)</span>, a unit error is assumed;
otherwise, the whole Exp(Argument) expression is set equal to 1.0
(Exp(Argument)=1).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Often, the Exp() expression occurs in the form of Form (1.0 – Exp()).
The Minus sign in it is replaced by a Plus sign. If the analysis of the
Exp() expression alone led to the result that it was set equal to 1, the
whole (1.0 – Exp()) expression is set equal to 1. This still requires
finding in the string the position of the left (opening) bracket.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In the case of a sum in the argument of Sqrt(), e.g., for the
variance of a net count rate with three terms with the unit (1/s^2),
the value 3.0 * (1/s^2) is expected for the argument. If, in this
example, the factor 3.0 is not obtained, but a non-integer value, it
can be assumed that at least one of the three terms carries a
differing unit. If, however, an integer-valued factor is obtained,
the whole sqrt expression can be replaced by the unit 1.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Following the replacement of an algebraic function expression for
equation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> by substrings containing the characteristic unit
values, a formula string should have been obtained (as a string
RSeiteG2(i)), which can be evaluated by <em>seval</em>. The resulting numerical
value is <em>Evalue</em>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-physical-units-test-eq2">
<span class="eqno">(5.21.2)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-physical-units-test-eq2" title="Link to this equation">¶</a></span>\[\mathbf{Evalue}\  = \ seval(RSeiteG2(i))\ /\ uconv(i)\]</div>
<p>Arrived at this stage, it may have happened that some unities cancelled
out.</p>
<p>The question then arises, how many – and which ones – basic units remain</p>
<p>to contribute to <em>Evalue</em> (Eq. <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-physical-units-test-eq2">(5.21.2)</a>)? Therefore, in this formula string,
the individual unit values, like “21.0“ for “s“ string, are replaced by
their basic units ( as strings). Based on pairs “Basic unit name, unit
value“, which are taken from the first two columns of the file
unitsTable.csv, the more complex function parser <em>parsef</em> can be used
for calculating partial derivatives of the formula <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> with
respect to the basic units. Only such individual units contribute to the
unit of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> which show partial derivatives having (practically)
non-zero values.</p>
<p>Now, when the set of participating unit parts is known, e.g., “Bq“, “s“
and “kg“, it has to be found out, which of them belong to the nominator
or to the denominator of a generalized product. For these three unit
parts, abbreviated now by a, b and c, the following <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2^{3} = 8\)</span>
possibilities have to tested:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-physical-units-test-eq3">
<span class="eqno">(5.21.3)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-physical-units-test-eq3" title="Link to this equation">¶</a></span>\[a^{\pm 1} \cdot b^{\pm 1} \cdot c^{\pm 1}\]</div>
<p>The 8 possible combinations are tested numerically; if one of it results
in the above-mentioned value <em>Evalue</em> Eq. <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-physical-units-test-eq2">(5.21.2)</a> ), the correct combination
is found: e.g., “Bq*s/kg“, if the value <em>Evalue</em> is equal to
11.0*21.0/41.0.</p>

<p>First, the units of all (independent) input quantities are replaced by
basic units. If this implies a scaling factor not being one, the
associate quantity value is (temporarily) multiplied with this factor.</p>
<p>In the next step, the units of the dependent quantities are calculated
from the just treated input quantity units as described above.</p>
<p>The scaling factors of the dependent quantities are not derived from
unit calculations. Instead, after the modification of the input
quantities, they are calculated internally using the function Resulta
without considering their units. Their associated unit scaling factors
unit_conv_factor() are calculated thereafter, simply as ratios of the
new quantity values and their previous values. Values of the
uncertainties are then scaled by these factors unit_conv_factor().</p>

<li><p>The calculation of units implies the conversion to basic units. If
other basic units are desired, the latter must be declared as basic
units in the file unitsTable.csv. For example, if the unit kg shall
be replaced by the unit g, make g to the basic unit and the kg to a
derived unit.</p></li>
<li><p>If the project contains a Trigger variable, invoking the unit test
modus is prevented from invoking. The reason is, that a modified

<li><p>If the test modus still indicates errors, this modus must be finished
with explicitly using the close button of the Editor Tab. This leads
to restoring the original status of program data.</p></li>
<li><p>If no unit-related errors are shown, an addition button appears. It
allows to save the modified state of the project as a new project

<p>The program executes the calculations according to
<a class="reference internal" href="#explaining-the-calculation-of-units-of-dependent-quantities"><span class="std std-numref">Section 5.21.2</span></a> and
then displays in the program editor a comparison for the list of
symbols.</p>

<p>For dependent quantities (indexes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span>), the unit names given
primarily by the user are replaced by “calculated“ unit names, which
means that one must take care about the changed status of the project.</p>
<p>For the output of this test, UncertRadio calculates scaled values of
measurement and associated standard uncertainties (<em>MVals_scd</em> und
<em>StdUnc_scd</em>) as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The column „MVal_scd/MVals_org“ shows the obtained actual scaling
factors unit_conv_factor().</p></li>
<li><p>The values <em>Mvals_scd</em> (dependent), derived with the function Resulta
from the modified (independent) input quantity values.</p></li>
<li><p>All values <em>StdUnc_scd</em>, by scaling the previous values <em>StdUnc_org</em>
with the factors unit_conv_factor().</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The output of the comparison test in the editor starts with a first
error message, if the comparison between the value Evalue (Eq. <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-physical-units-test-eq2">(5.21.2)</a>) and
values from Eq. <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-physical-units-test-eq3">(5.21.3)</a> (previous section) does not come to any agreement.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">5.21.5. </span>Introduction of Trigger variables<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-of-trigger-variables" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The program cannot give direct recommendations how to proceed if the
test runs into an error. One reason can be a scaling factor which
already exists in an equation like 60 for transforming “min“ into “s“.
The impact by such already existing scaling factors can be reduced by
using special switching variables (see section <a class="reference internal" href="../content/numericalProcedures/switch_variables.html#using-switching-variables-in-equations"><span class="std std-numref">Section 1.2.6</span></a>):
for “Minutes
(min)“ or for “Gram (g)“ already existing scaling factors 60 or 1/1000
are to be replaced as follows (alternatively, these factors are replaced
by 1 and their unit is changed explicitly to “s” of “kg”):</p>
<p>60 60^min_Trigger</p>
<p>1/1000 1/1000^kilo_Trigger</p>
<p>These two special Trigger names are directly interpreted by UncertRadio;
the value zero is assigned to them, if the Menu item „test physical
units“ is applied, and prior to the test, they get the value 1.</p>
<p>The problem, that the expected unit of the output quantity, “Bq“ in the
case of an activity, does not contain the substring “Bq“, but “1/s“
instead, can very often be solved by attributing the unit “1/Bq/s” to
the detection probability.</p>
<p><strong>Test example: Janszen-Sr-89-Sr-90_V2_DE.txp</strong></p>
<p>The execution of the test stops with an error message. Then, the
following changes are applied:</p>
<p>The first two equations:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>a89 = As89 / (ms/1000.)
a90 = AsS90 / (ms/1000.)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>are changed to:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>a89 = As89 / (ms/1000.^kilo_Trigger)
a90 = AS90 / (ms/1000.^kilo_Trigger)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To obtain the desired unit “Bq/kg“, set the units of the four detection
probabilities epsXXX to “1/Bq/s”.</p>
<p>The project file including these changes is available as
<strong>Janszen-Sr-89-Sr-90_V3_DE.txp</strong>.</p>
<p>If a unit error is introduced, e.g., by changing in the symbol table
under the TAB “Equations“ the unit of t2m0 from “s“ to “min“, then move
the calculations forward to the <a class="reference internal" href="../first_steps/TABS/Results.html#tab-results"><span class="std std-ref">TAB “Results”</span></a>.
An expected error message
is then obtained when the unit test is called, in this case:</p>
<p>Error messages:</p>
<p>Eq. #=8 Error CLCU: Units in EXP argument do not match:
seval=-60.0000000 arg(EXP)=-(1.0/21.0) * ( 6.000000E+01*(21.0))</p>
<p>Eq. #=4 RD89 = RSr - w*RY*f7 - Abl*(etaSr * epsSrSr89 * f1): no unit
found! Einvor=1 RSide=RSR-W*RY*F7-ABL*(ETASR*EPSSRSR89*F1)</p>
<p><strong>Similar changes</strong> had to be applied to the project
<strong>Moreno-Sr90_IAEA-135_EN.txp</strong>.</p>
<p>The unit-strings “u (uamu)“ were replaced by “u“. Within the equations
for the quantities a, w, f2 and epsSr, the two switching variables
“kilo_Trigger” or “min_Trigger” were introduced. A unit “mg Sr“ was
replaced by “mg“.</p>
<p>The project file including these changes is available as
<strong>Moreno-Sr90_IAEA-135_V2_EN.txp</strong>.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">5.21.6. </span>Experiences with the option for calculating units<a class="headerlink" href="#experiences-with-the-option-for-calculating-units" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The experience with the option for testing or calculating physical
quantities could be improved with the version 2.4.21. As such, this
option could be integrated for the first time in the test with
„QC-Batch-Test“, i.e., into the automatic evaluation run over all
example projects. This allowed to identify some projects exhibiting
specially selected units, for example,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Wuebbeler_Ex2*.txp (Ohm, Volt, Ampere)</p></li>
<li><p>Sterlinski*.txp (n-activation, unit ng/g).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the projects Kessel*.txp and Calibration-of-weight-Cox*.txp
(calibration of masses), deviating factors of 1000 were observed. The
project Calibration-of-weight-Cox*.txp is still too complicated with
respect to deriving units. For the projects Neutron-dose-Cox-2006*.txp,
changes of the resulting value by a factor of 100 per 36 are observed
from changes in the input quantity units.</p>
<p>These projects are left as they are.</p>
<p>A real unit error was observed with the four projects sumEval*V2*.txp
(DE+EN). For their version V2, at that time, the output quantity unit
was set Bq/m²t, however, the associated area of 400 cm² had not been
changed to 0,04 m². This error of the V2 version now soon became obvious
by the new test modus. The new project version shown with the correct
units, but output quantity values changed by the factor 100x100, has
been saved, while still being in the test mode, as version V3 projects.</p>
<p>From the project Moreno-Sr90_IAEA-135_V2*.txp, the triggers and the
associated scaling factors of 60 or 1000 have been removed from the
evaluation equations and the projects were then successful tested for
unit calculations. With the processed derived units, the missing of the
constant factors has been equalized. Value and uncertainty of the output
quantity finally is left unchanged. The new project produced within the
test modus is now released as a V3 version.</p>
<p>The same applied to the project Janszen-Sr-89-Sr-90_V3*.txp. The
kilo_trigger and the associated of the mass (g) were removed. The
missing factor of 1000 in the equations has been equalized by the unit
calculations, value and uncertainty of the output quantity are left
unchanged. A new version V4 of these projects have been produced.</p>
