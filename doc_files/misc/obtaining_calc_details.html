<h1><span class="section-number">5.18. </span>Obtaining MC distributions and statistics derived of it in detail<a class="headerlink" href="#obtaining-mc-distributions-and-statistics-derived-of-it-in-detail" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>During the Monte Carlo simulation successively three different
distributions are produced from which some statistics are derived. The
latter are the arithmetic mean, the standard deviation of the
distribution and especially certain quantiles.</p>
<p>At the beginning the (large) number N of simulated measurement values of
the output quantity is defined. This defines one “run”. Several runs
(number <em>r</em>; maximum 50) may be calculated which then allows statistical
evaluations to be made of the statistics mentioned above; from the
r-fold repetition of the simulation one gets for instance with the
standard deviation of the <em>r</em> values of a statistic an indication of its
uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>Determining a quantile</strong></p>
<p>The MC procedure use previously was primarily designed for nearly
symmetric distributions of the output quantity. With applying more and
more the GUM Supplement 1 with asymmetric distributions of some specific
input quantities may result in a rather asymmetric distribution of the
output quantity. Extreme values, to be expected for the distribution,
had to be fixed in the program in advance, which turned out to be a
disadvantage.</p>
<p>Therefore, with version 2.1.9 the MC procedure was modified – and
thereby simplified, in that all MC values of the output quantity are now
store in an array. Now, for every of the three above mentioned
distributions MC simulation yields arrays of up to 2 000 000 MC values.
From these arrays mean and standard deviation are easily calculated.
Quantiles are estimated by a distribution-free method, which requires
sorting the arrays first. Only for the purpose of graphical
representation as a histogram, the MC values have to be sorted into
20 000 Bins („multi-channel“); the limits of the histograms are
determined after the MC simulation – and not before. These modifications
made the MC procedure code easier to handle.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Bayesian estimates</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><p>For the estimation of mean, standard deviation and lower and upper
confidence limits according to the Bayesian method only the
distribution truncated at zero is used, values below zero are not
used and not considered for the total number of values. The
confidence limits are estimated as lower and upper quantile of the
distribution. The total number of values considered in one run is
only about N/2.</p>
<p>With Version 1.03 an option was added within the dialog „Results“, MC
section, with which it is possible to calculate a special pair of
coverage limits which has the shortest distance (Bayesian coverage
interval of shortest length) instead of the symmetrical confidence
limits. Test case: Neutron-Dose-Cox-2006_EN.txp. The activation of
this option does not lead to a significant increase of simulation
duration.</p>
<p>Input parameters being associated with an asymmetric or rectangular
distribution may result in a significant <strong>asymmetry of the output
quantity distribution</strong>. In the decision threshold case this may
cause some deviation of the mean value from zero.</p>
<p>At first, a deviation from an expected distribution symmetrically to
zero is tested. This is done by comparing the mean value
<em>y</em><sub>1</sub>, deviating from zero, with the MC uncertainty of the
mean, <em>u</em>(<em>y</em><sub>1</sub>)/√<em>N</em> (see below). In the case of</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{y_{1}}{u\left( y_{1} \right)/\sqrt{N}} &gt; 0.10\ \)</span></p>
<p><strong>an iteration is performed for the decision threshold using the
secant method</strong>, which shifts the mean value closer to zero<strong>.</strong> If
necessary, up to 12 steps are performed, each of them requiring a
full MC simulation; this leads to increasing computational effort. If
the above ratio does not fall below 0.10, that distribution with the
lowest ratio is selected from those of the 12 steps, from which the
decision threshold is then calculated. <em>y</em><sub>1</sub> can be reduced
by typically one to two orders of magnitude; it may happen, however,
that <em>y</em><sub>1</sub> is reduced by hardly more that a factor of 10.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p><strong>Decision threshold</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><p>For the estimation of the Decision threshold a modification is
applied which consists of setting the “true value” of the net
counting rate (thereby also of the activity) equal to zero. This
results in a distribution which to about 50 % has negative values. In
this case, no truncation at zero is applied. The upper
(1-<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span>) quantile of this distribution represents the
simulated value of the Decision threshold.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li><p><strong>Detection limit</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The estimation of the Detection limit is the most time-consuming part
of the simulation, because in this case the distribution is shifted
several times by changing the mean of the distribution, each time
after the total number <em>N</em> is reached. The aim of the step-wise
shifting hereby is that the (lower) ß Quantile of this distribution
has to come as close to the value of the Decision threshold
(determined before, see above) as possible. This iteration procedure
is based on a bi-section method but with dividing the interval by
linear interpolation.</p>
<p>Negative values are explicitly considered in these calculations.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The motivation not to discard negative parts of the distributions for
the estimation of Decision threshold and Detection limit comes from the
fact that the primary result for the output quantity shall be directly
comparable with Decision threshold. If the negative parts would be
discarded, a transformation being in analogy to the truncation would
have to be applied to the primary output quantity before such a
comparison</p>
<p>To make the distributions non-negative in the case of the Bayesian
estimates is possible after a comparison between primary output quantity
and the Decision limit has been done and has led to the conclusion that
the assumption of a non-zero activity value in the sample is true.</p>
<p><strong>Estimating the MC uncertainties of the characteristic values</strong></p>
<p>Performing a MC-Simulation with only one single run did up to now not
give any estimates of the uncertainties associated the characteristic
values. Furthermore, when using a small number of runs, the estimates
obtained from the spreading within the runs also are not very reliable.</p>
<p>As the resulting MC distributions in most cases are normal
distributions, uncertainties of characteristic values can be roughly
estimated as follows (see e.g. Barlow, 1999):</p>

<p>(N: number of MC-simulated single measurements; ϕ(.) and Φ(.): density
function and distribution function of the standard normal distribution,
respectively; see Options dialog for the probabilities α, β and γ).</p>
<p>The MC uncertainties calculated according to this table are given as
relative values in percent within the MC part under the TAB „Results“,
but only in the case of one single run.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical presentations</strong></p>
<p>The distributions which are produced according to the three methods
discussed above are displayed as histograms in a separate window while
the simulation is running. They show each distribution accumulated from
the <em>r</em> runs which stabilize after only few (of <em>r</em>) repetitions. In the
case of the Detection limit the accumulated distribution is displayed
after the <em>r</em> runs are terminated. The x-axis (abscissa) corresponds to
values of the evaluated quantity shown in the title of a plot; the
y-axis (ordinate) shows the probability.</p>
<p>Example of the separate window with the MC graphs:</p>
<figure class="align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/MCplotfile_d.png"><img alt="Monte-Carlo results based on `Alpha-IAEA-1401-Kanisch_EN.txp`" src="../../_images/MCplotfile_d.png" style="width: 474.75px; height: 735.75px;" />
</a>
</figure>
<p><strong>Vertical green lines</strong> in the graphs characterize, from the left to
the right, the following values:</p>
<p><strong>distribution of: values:</strong></p>
<p>output quantity lower confidence limit, best estimate (Bayesian), upper
confidence limit</p>
<p>Decision threshold its value</p>
<p>Detection limit Decision threshold, Detection limit</p>
<p>After each single MC run that <strong>Gaussian curve is potted in blue color</strong>
which corresponds to the result of the analytical procedure.</p>
<p>Note: The separate window with the MC graphs is maintained after
completion of the MC simulation calculations. This allows for additional
inspection of data shown under the different TABs and for invoking a
result report and to go then back to “Results” TAB with this window. If
data or options were changed during this step having the consequence
that the original assumptions underlying the MC simulation are no longer
valid, this MC window will be closed. This is also done when again
calculations in the <a class="reference internal" href="../first_steps/TABS/Values_Uncertainties.html#tab-values-uncertainties"><span class="std std-ref">TAB “Values, Uncertainties”</span></a> or calculations
initiated by the change from <a class="reference internal" href="../first_steps/TABS/Values_Uncertainties.html#tab-values-uncertainties"><span class="std std-ref">TAB “Values, Uncertainties”</span></a> to the TAB
<a class="reference internal" href="../first_steps/TABS/Uncertainty_Budget.html#tab-uncertainty-budget"><span class="std std-ref">TAB “Uncertainty Budget”</span></a> are invoked.</p>
