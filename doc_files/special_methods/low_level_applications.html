<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>In 2024 it turned out, that the (N+x)-rule is not clearly state in ISO 11929.
Thus, the described implementation in UR might not be correct. Therefore,
it is up to the user to decide to use it.</p>
</div>
<p>Very low numbers of counts N are Poisson-distributed instead of
Gaussian-distributed. Using Bayesian methods it can be shown that
counting rates derived from them then are Gamma-distributed. Taking a
prior assumed as uniform (Weise et al., 2009) results in an expected
value of the counting rate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R\ \)</span>which is characterized by
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\widehat{R} = (N + x)/t_{m}\ \)</span>with a value of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(u^{2}\left( \widehat{R} \right) = (N + x)/(t_{m}^{2}\ ) = \widehat{R}/t_{m}\ \)</span>for
its variance. From this the recommendation follows, for the case of very
low counting numbers, to replace <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> by<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ N + x\)</span>, <strong>being
designated as the</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left( \mathbf{N + x} \right)\)</span> <strong>Rule here</strong>
which is long known from the literature.</p>
<p>The symbol x in (N+x) may be considered as a variable designated as
GamDistAdd in UR. This results in a Gamma distribution of the variable
(count number) associated with this rule, which from a Bayesian view
results from a prior which is proportional to 1/ρ (GamDistAdd=0.0), to
ρ<sup>-1/2</sup> (GamDistAdd=0.5) or which is constant (GamDistAdd=1).</p>

<p>It is assumed here that this rule only refers to the gross counting rate
<em>R</em><sub>g</sub> and to the background counting rate <em>R</em><sub>0</sub>, because
other types of counting rates usually are determined by other methods
being less direct than a measurement. Within the UncertRadio dialog, the
values of these two counting rates do not require modification, if the
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((N + x)\)</span> Rule is applied directly to the gross and background
counting numbers, <em>N</em><sub>b</sub> and <em>N</em><sub>0</sub>, respectively. Within
the program code the following replacement rule is applied:</p>
<p><em>Directly before</em> a program part which is doing calculations with the
counting numbers:</p>
<p><em>N</em><sub>b</sub> is replaced by the term (<em>N</em><sub>b</sub>+ GamDistAdd),</p>
<p><em>N</em><sub>0</sub> is replaced by the term (<em>N</em><sub>0</sub>+ GamDistAdd).</p>
<p><em>After that</em> program part: these replacements are removed.</p>
<p>The default value of GamDistAdd is 1.</p>
<p>The application of the (<em>N</em>+x) rule to the two mentioned counting
numbers is made available within the TAB “Values, Uncertainties” by
selecting “(<em>N</em>+x) rule” as type of distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Note: Only for counting number variables the (N+x) rule may be
selected; it must not be selected for the associated counting rate
variables.</strong> The latter are treated in this way internally and thereby
are also gamma-distributed. This means, that this rule is correctly
applicable only if a counting rate R is defined by an equation R=N/t
containing the associated number of counts N. For N only a value is
given by the user, while the field for the uncertainty must be left
empty; this uncertainty obtained by the gamma-distribution is then
calculated internally.</p>
<p>Two example projects (Gamma-Dist_EN.txp and Lira_gammdist_EN.txp)
demonstrate the application of the (<em>N</em>+x) rule for the case of very
low counting numbers.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>In anticipation of the new version of ISO
11929:2019 the application of the (N+x) rule has been modified as
follows. Apart from a single exception, x=0 is used in (N+x). The
exception is N=0: then x=1 is used. This requires that the variable
GamDistAdd must be set to zero ( Options – Presettings). Under this
prerequisite, x=GamDistAdd=0, UncertRadio internally adds 1 to N only
if N=0 (this means “0+1”). This means that for N&gt;0 a Gamma
distribution is applied for the associated count rate R with a
prior(R) ~ 1/R. In contrast, for N=0 a uniform prior(R) is assumed.**</p>
<p>If, however, x=GamDistAdd has been set a value &gt; 0, which may be
true for already existing UR projects, it will always be added to N,
also for N&gt;0.</p>
</div>
<p>It is assumed that the (<em>N</em>+x) rule may be used only with measurement
procedures not requiring a linear least-squares method – and only in the
case of very low counting numbers. <strong>For procedures using the least
squares method</strong> applied to low counts the fitting result would be
questionable; in that case where the Poisson distribution has to be
used, the least squares method would be biased and e.g. the
Poisson-Maximum-Likelihood-Estimation would have to be applied.</p>
<p>With the following example, based on Gamma-Dist_EN.txp, it shall be
demonstrated that applying the MC simulation may result in asymmetric
distributions deviating substantially from the normal distribution.</p>
<p>The equations may be as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A = phi * Rn</p></li>
<li><p>Rn = Rg - R0</p></li>
<li><p>Rg = ng / t</p></li>
<li><p>R0 = n0 / t0</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The (N+1) rule is selected for the quantities ng and n0.</p>
<p>The starting case may be given by: Phi = 1, urel(Phi) = 0,1, t =100 s
and t0 = 500 s as well as ng = 8 counts and n0 = 6 counts, i.e. Rg =
(8+1)/100=0,09 s<sup>-1</sup> and R0 = (6+1)/500=0,014 s<sup>-1</sup>. The
MC-Simulation leads to the following triple graph, showing a slight
asymmetry of the simulated (green) distributions:</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For the next case, with t0 = 500 s, but n0 = 0 counts, especially the
distribution of the decision threshold (following triple graph) shows an
even more pronounced asymmetry. This asymmetry is the reason that the MC
value of the decision threshold is about the double of that of the
analytical procedure (blue curve).</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="id2">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/MCplotfile_b.png"><img alt="n0 set to null, based on Gamma-Dist_EN.txp" src="../../_images/MCplotfile_b.png" style="width: 474.75px; height: 735.75px;" />

<p><span class="caption-number">Fig. 4.7.2 </span><span class="caption-text">n0 set to null</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Link to this image">¶</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As a third case, compared to the starting case, only the background
counting duration t0 is increased to a value of t0 = 60t = 10000 s (a
case seldom encountered in practice), which makes the background
counting rate R0 very small, especially for the decision threshold a
very asymmetric distribution is obtained from which only a very small
part is within the negative region. This shape arising from the Gamma
distribution is quite different from what one is usually dealing with,
e.g., shown under <a class="reference internal" href="../misc/obtaining_calc_details.html#obtaining-mc-distributions-and-statistics-derived-of-it-in-detail"><span class="std std-ref">Obtaining MC distributions and statistics derived of it in detail</span></a>.</p>

<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/MCplotfile_c.png"><img alt="t0 enlarged to t0=60 t, based on Gamma-Dist_EN.txp" src="../../_images/MCplotfile_c.png" style="width: 474.75px; height: 735.75px;" />

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The reason is given by the fact that with such a small background
counting rate the distribution of the decision threshold is mainly
affected by the gross counting rate for which the Gamma distribution for
very low counting numbers is very asymmetric and always has positive
possible values.</p>
