Changes within the Options menu
-------------------------------

Only the change from :ref:`tab “values, uncertainties”` to the TAB
“Uncertainty budget”** initiates the calculation of decision threshold,
detection limit, result and further statistical parameters (shown later
in the :ref:`tab “results”`). These calculations depend on the parameter
settings in the **menu Options – pre-settings**.

If parameters therein have been changed these calculations have to be repeated which is
achieved by the above-mentioned TAB change. Take note of the hint
occurring then in the right-most status bar field which indicates how to
continue then.
