Dialog “Values of decay curve”
------------------------------

The following picture gives an overview of the structure of the dialog.

.. image:: /images/dialog_value_decay_curve.png

Initially, in this dialog **date and time of the Y-90/Sr-90 separation**
is entered using the format “DD.MM.YYYY HH:MM:SS”, e.g. “12.06.2006
09:05:00”. It is recommended to use the 4-digit version of the year. The
program internally replaces all decimal dots by blanks and then reads
the six date/time elements format-free.

One can choose between s and min for the
**basis time unit for the counting time**.
Internally, if min is chosen by the user, this is
converted to the basic unit s.

The value of the net blank counting rate shown (disabled) in this dialog
is that of the symbol *Rbl*, which has been entered by the user within
the TAB „Values, uncertainties“. It must not contain a detector
background contribution.

For the **input of the single measurement values of the decay curve** a
table with 11 columns is available, the 11 columns of which have the
following meaning; therein, only those columns shown in black color
shall be filled in by the user, while the columns with red color are
calculated by the program (see below).

+----------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|| Column  || Name           || Meaning                                           |
||         ||                ||                                                   |
+==========+=================+====================================================+
|| 1       || Start date     || Date/time of the start of the `k`-th measurement  |
||         ||                || (input format as shown above), or,                |
||         ||                || time duration between Y-90/Sr-90 separation and   |
||         ||                || the start of the `k`-th measurement (as a number  |
||         ||                || with decimal point); the program realizes         |
||         ||                || automatically which of the two possibilities is   |
||         ||                || used.                                             |
+----------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| 2        | Count time      | Counting time of the `k`-th measurement            |
+----------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| 3        | Counts          | Gross counts of the `k`-th measurement             |
+----------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| 4        | CountRate       | Calculated gross counting rate                     |
+----------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| 5        | u(CountRate)    | Uncertainty of the gross counting rate             |
+----------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| 6        | Count time      | Counting time of the `k`-th background measurement |
+----------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| 7        | Counts          | Counts of the `k`-th background measurement        |
+----------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| 8        | CountRate       | Calculated background counting rate                |
+----------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| 9        | u(CountRate)    | Uncertainty of the background counting rate        |
+----------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| 10       | NetCountRate    | Calculated net counting rate                       |
+----------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| 11       | u(NetCountRate) | Uncertainty of the net counting rate               |
+----------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+

With the **button „Calculate count rates“** the values of gross counting
rate, background counting rate and the net counting rate as well as
their associated uncertainties are calculated in the columns 4/5, 8/9
and 10/11 (in the columns marked by red color). In this calculation, the
value of the net blank counting rate *:math:`R_{bl}`* is considered (see above).

**Simplifying input to columns 2, 6 und 7:**

A new option within this dialog has been inserted, by which within one
of these columns a fixed value can be transferred to all necessary cells
within the selected column.

.. tip::
    **Import from ASCII file:**
    If the values to be entered into the first
    three columns exist as an ASCII file, also column-wise separated, each
    of those columns (one after another) can be marked and copied into the
    Windows clipboard and pasted into the corresponding UncertRadio dialog
    column (right Mouse button: “paste”). The mouse pointer needs only to be
    set into the uppermost cell of this column in advance.


.. tip::
    **Import from Excel file:**
    If the values to be entered exist already in
    an Excel file they can be copied with a mouse operation “copy and paste”
    via Windows clipboard to the corresponding cell area in the UncertRadio
    dialog. In this case, all three columns can be copied simultaneously in
    one step.
