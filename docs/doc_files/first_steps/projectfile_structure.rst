Structure of the project file
-----------------------------

Knowing the structure of a project file is useful for a semi-automated
usage of UncertRadio. For a regularly repeated Sr-89/Sr-90 analysis,
e.g., with linear unfolding and a fixed scheme, one will probably be
able to establish a basic version of that UncertRadio project file where
some parts in it will (nearly) not change. Another part will change,
however, from measurement to measurement. The latter data may e.g. be
written directly into that file using a small Visual Basic program (MS
Excel).

In addition to the existing version of a project file as .txp text file
the structure of which is described below, a CSV file version was
introduced in autumn 2013; the latter will be discussed at the end of
this help topic.

Project file as text file in .TXP format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This may done by first copying the basic version of the project file to
a working project file, also with extension .txp, e.g. to "Test2.txp".
Only when passing special keywords (those with preceding @, see below),
those data from the actual measurement are written into that working
file. After closing the working file one can call UR e.g. directly from
a Visual Basic program such that UR is initially loading just this
edited project file, by some command like "start uncertradio.exe
Test2.txp". Such as call can also be done like:


.. code-block:: bash

   Uncertradio.exe Test2.txp


The table following below shows the simple structure of a project file
(extension TXP).

    Numbers always with . as decimal point (no comma!)!

Project file in the Excel-compatible .CSV format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The structure of the CSV format is similarly to that of the \*.TXP
format. It is also included in the preceding table describing the
structure of the txp format. The following figure shows an example.
**@Sonstige** from the txp format is found under **Optionen**.

.. note::
    If one loads a `TXP` project file into UR and saves it in
    CSV format, one should not edit this CSV file with Excel and saves it
    again from within Excel. The reason is that Excel saves this CSV file by
    modifying the real numbers in it by reducing their numbers of decimals,
    which may lead then to slightly different results when loading this file
    again into UR. Such a manual editing of the CSV file should better be
    done by using a simple text editor such as Notepad.

As the automated usage of UR can be done via an Excel application, it
could be confirmed that this problem does not occur when using the
export to CSV from within Excel via an VBA code.

Notes about the input of input quantity uncertainties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is to be noted that uncertainties of input quantities can be entered
in different fields. These are given in the following table, which
corresponds to the TAB "Values, uncertainties".

Using the \*.TXP format of the project file, these fields are found
under the section @Unc-Grid: described under the 6\ :sup:`th` to the
9\ :sup:`th` bullet; in the CSV format these are the columns 5 – 8 (E –
H) under the section "Values, uncertainties".

An uncertainty values must not be entered in column 10; dependent on the
distribution types, it has to be entered in one of those columns given
as the columns 6 to 9 in the following table.

+--------+------------+---------+------------------------------------------------+
| column | name       | type    | description                                    |

||       ||           ||        || be over-written by the program!               |
+--------+------------+---------+------------------------------------------------+

If values are entered in columns 6 to 8 with a coverage factor unequal
to 1, the parameter coverin within the same project file must be set
equal to the coverage factor just applied. UncertRadio then converts all
input uncertainties to the internal coverage factor 1; after the
calculations, UncertRadio multiplies the output uncertainties with the
value of the parameter coverf defined in the project file.
