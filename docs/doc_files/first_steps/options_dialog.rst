Options dialog - Presetting

This dialog allows the definition of the following parameters used in
the calculations of Decision threshold and Detection limit:

-  **Quantiles of the normal distribution**, :math:`k_{1 - \alpha}`
   **and** :math:`k_{1 - \beta}`\ **, and their associated probabilities
   for the errors of the first and second kind,**
   :math:`\mathbf{\alpha}` **and** :math:`\mathbf{\beta}`\ **,**
   respectively. The program only works with the values of the quantiles
   :math:`k_{1 - \alpha}` and :math:`k_{1 - \beta}`; it is, however,
   possible to define first the error probabilities from which in turn
   the quantiles are determined then.

   **Presetting** in the case of preparing a new project:

   | k-alpha = 1.644854, alpha = 0.05
   | k-beta = 1.644854, beta = 0.05.

   If a quantile value is modified, the associated probability value
   must be changed; this is indicated by disabling its editing and the
   button "adjust" (above) becomes activatable. In the case of modifying
   a probability value first, the procedure is just vice versa. By
   clicking the "adjust" button, the other associated value is adjusted;
   without this adjustment the dialog cannot be closed.

-  the **method of defining Decision thresholds and Detection limits**:
   only the method of ISO 11929:2019 is available.

-  For the calculation of the limits of the (two-sided) confidence
   interval (better: coverage interval), the value of the associated
   probability :math:`(1 - \gamma)` is needed, which can be given in the
   corresponding field. The default value is
   :math:`(1 - \gamma) = 0.95`.

-  The value of the **coverage factor k** is required for calculating
   the expanded uncertainty, which can be defined in the field
   **coverage factor output**. Its pre-set value is 1 (internal variable
   coverf).

-  If in a project file the uncertainties of the listed independent
   input quantities are given as expanded uncertainties, its associated
   coverage factor needs to be removed while reading them in. This
   coverage factor can be given in the field **coverage factor input**.
   Its pre-set value is 1 (internal variable coverin).


   Usually, coverin=1 is applied when working with a project within
   UncertRadio by dialog. The value coverin=2 probably will be
   restricted to the case when UncertRadio used in an automated way from
   within another program. An Excel application prepares a project file
   filled with data within Excel and calls UncertRadio for evaluating
   it. If the input quantity uncertainties had been entered in Excel
   with coverin=2,and the parameter coverin=2 is given in the project
   file, UncertRadio converts these uncertainties to k=1 by dividing
   them by the coverin value. The internal calculations are all done
   with a coverage factor of 1. Just before the output to an external
   CSV file, which then will be imported by Excel, UncertRadio
   multiplies the uncertainty values with the value of the parameter
   coverf, which also has to be defined in the project file.

   When using UncertRadio in the automated way, care has to be taken
   about how to correctly insert the uncertainty values into the project
   file: refer to :numref:`notes about the input of input quantity uncertainties`.

-  The dialog contains an **input field for a variable GamDistAdd**.
   This parameter represents the x in the (N+x) rule for counts or
   counting rates, between 0 and 1. The values 0, Â½ und 1 for GamDistAdd
   correspond to common priors within a Bayesian view, which are
   proportional to :math:`\nu^{- (1 - c)}`, with *c*\ =GamDistAdd. For
   variables for which the (N+x) rule has been selected, a corresponding
   Gamma distribution is assumed.

+--------------------------+---------------+---------------------------+
| *c*\ =GamDistAdd         | (1-c)         | mean                      |
+==========================+===============+===========================+
| 0                        | 1             | N+0                       |
+--------------------------+---------------+---------------------------+
| 1/2                      | 1/2           | N+1/2                     |
+--------------------------+---------------+---------------------------+
| 1                        | 0             | N+1                       |

-  The **language** output within the program and its dialogs and the
   can be switched between German and English after the program start;
   the list separator character can also be selected. See also:
