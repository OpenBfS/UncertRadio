TAB “Equations”
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. One must begin with the first enabled ASCII text field (the
   uppermost, the only one enabled when beginning with a new project), in
   which equations are to be inserted line-by-line: :ref:`text field for equations`.

#. If all equations have been given formula symbols are extracted from
   them by clicking the **button** **"Load symbols(1) from equations"**,
   followed by a syntax check using the internal function parser and the
   symbols are loaded into a table which then may be edited and values in
   the columns *Unit* and *Meaning* may be added.

   After having edited the equations, the following cases may occur
   regarding already existing symbols:

   a. New symbols have been introduced. The corresponding symbol table
      rows are green colored.

   b. Already defined symbols are no longer needed (**dispensable
      symbols**). The corresponding symbol table rows are put to the end of
      the table being yellow colored.

      The yellow-colored table rows must at first be marked/selected with
      the mouse; then, they are removed using the toolbar icon **„delete rows“**
      |delete-row|.
      Some symbols, not directly used within the
      equations, but still needed (e. g., counting durations), must not be
      deleted.

      For further editing: see :ref:`editing the symbol list`.

      For such quantities within the symbol list, for which mean and variance
      are to be determined from an associated data set, the value “m“ is set in
      the column “type“ instead of “a“ (dependent quantity) or “u“ (independent quantity).
      Furthermore, if a quantity, to be calculated by an equation, shall be used as a
      parameter without uncertainty, the type value “p“ can be used.

#. After the symbol list has been completed (in the testing phase units
   and meanings need not yet to be defined) by a mouse click on the
   **button “Load symbols(2) of the finalized symbol table”** the complete
   symbol list is loaded for the calculations to be done.

#. Now, the two **selection fields** “\ **Net count rate**\ ” and
   “\ **Gross count rate**\ ” are enabled. They allow selecting the
   appropriate symbols for the net counting rate and the gross counting
   rate. For the further course through the program **these selections are
   only of interest to the calculations of Decision threshold and Detection
   limit**. After having selected them they have to be loaded by clicking
   the button “Accept net and gross count rates”.

   If more than one output quantity is defined, those symbols for the net
   and gross counting rate must be chosen belonging to the actually active
   output quantity.

   .. note::
      The identification of the net counting rate (more precisely: of
      the procedure dependent net counting rate, see :ref:`numerical procedures`)
      is needed to allow within the iteration for the Detection limit a simple
      numerical inversion of the equations, from the varied output quantity
      (e.g. activity in Bq/kg wet weight) back to the net counting rate (in
      :math:`s^{- 1}`). The gross count rate symbol must be identified because
      the user has to supply the uncertainty function for it; for the
      determination of Decision threshold and Detection limit the value of the
      gross count rate is varied internally where this uncertainty function is
      then used to calculate its associated modified uncertainty value.

   **Exceptions:**

   a) in the analysis of a decay curve with linear Least squares fitting
      (calling **Linfit**) **the indication of a gross counting rates is
      not required**;

   b) similarly, in the case of estimating a mean of activities from
      individual gamma lines of a radionuclide (calling **Gamspk1**); the
      **selection of the gross counting rate is inapplicable**; the **net
      counting rate**, however, **has to be selected** **because it acts as
      placeholder for the source activity (Bq);**

   c) when summing up or averaging several aliquot measurements (calling
      **SumEval**)

   With these exception cases the symbol to be selected as net counting
   rate (or the source activity in the case of *Gamspk1*) must be that
   one which is defined in the equations by the call to *Linfit* or to
   *Gamspk1*.


#. After step 4 the TAB has been successfully treated and the next TAB
   to be treated, :ref:`TAB “Values, Uncertainties”` is enabled
   and selected then by a mouse click.
