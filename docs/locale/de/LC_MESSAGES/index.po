"The software **UncertRadio** enables the automated calculation of "
"characteristic threshold values of activity mesurements according to ISO "
"11929. These include the activity concentration or specific activity and "
"its combined standard measurement uncertainty, an uncertainty budget and "
"values of decision threshold and the detection limit. The uncertainties "
"of the single output values are calculated using numerical error "
"propagation according to ISO GUM."

"Die Software **UncertRadio** ermöglicht die automatisierte "
"Berechnung der charakteristischen Grenzen einer Aktivitätsbestimmung entsprechend "
"DIN ISO 11929. Im Detail werden die Aktivitätskonzentration bzw. die "
"spezifische Aktivität mit der dazugehörigen kombinierten Standardmessunsicherheit, "
"ihrem Unsicherheiten-Budget und den Werten der Erkennungsgrenze und der "
"Nachweisgrenze ermittelt. Die Unsicherheiten der einzelnen Ergebnisgrößen "

"**UncertRadio** can be used for a variety of applications from Alpha, "
"Beta and Gamma measurements, but also from dosimetry. It has the "
"capability to derive the characteristic values for up to three "
"radionuclides simultaneously, whose output quantity values, e.g. activity"
" values, of which are dependent from each other due to the measurement. "
"Therefore, it is especially suited for modern liquid scintillation "
"measurement procedures of e.g. Strontium isotopes."
msgstr ""
"**UncertRadio** lässt sich für vielfältige Anwendungen "
"der Alpha-, Beta- und Gammamessung, aber auch der "
"Dosimetrie einsetzen. Die Software kann die charakteristischen Grenzen "
"simultan für bis zu drei Radionuklide zu ermitteln, deren Ergebniswerte, "
"z. B. Aktivitätsmesswerte, durch das Messverfahren bedingt voneinander abhängig sind. "
"Es ist auch für die Auswertung bei modernen Verfahren der "
"Flüssigkeitsszintillationsmessung von z. B. Strontium-Isotopen verwendbar."
