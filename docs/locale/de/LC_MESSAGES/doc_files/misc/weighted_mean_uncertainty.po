"The factors :math:`1/u^{2}\\left( A_{i} \\right)` within the sums "
"contained in the equations (1-3) represent statistical weights. These "
"must be considered as being constant. Nevertheless, before they are "
"applied, they are calculated from other variable values "
":math:`x_{in}(j)`, which also contribute to the :math:`A_{i}`. If, after "
"having calculated Eq. (1), followed by a numerical uncertainty "
"propagation for :math:`\\overline{A}` with respect to the "
":math:`x_{in}(j)` by using differences quotients follows, the values "
":math:`u^{2}\\left( A_{i} \\right)` must not be modified. Under this "
"constraint the uncertainty propagation for Eq. (1) directly yields the "
"uncertainty given by Eq. (2). This condition is considered since version "
"2.4.05. The values :math:`u^{2}\\left( A_{i} \\right)` may only be "
"recalculated within the iterations for calculating the decision threshold"
" and the detection limit, once per single iteration step."

"**UncertRadio is calculating both, internal and external standard "
"uncertainty but for further internal calculations it makes only use of "
"the internal standard uncertainty.** The external standard deviation is "
"shown only for information. The reason for doing that is that for the "
"user it might be an useful information that the external standard "
"deviation is considerably larger than the internal standard deviation. "
"The latter can give advice about possible sources of errors which should "
"be considered."
