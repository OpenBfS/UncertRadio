"For applying this procedure, the quadratic covariance matrix **U\\ x** is"
" needed. UncertRadio assembles all the data into the corresponding "
"algebraic elements and calculates also the required elements of the "
"covariance matrix as already :ref:`calculation of the weighted mean and "
"its standard uncertainty` The matrix **U\\ y** consists of only one "
"element, the variance associated with weighted mean."
