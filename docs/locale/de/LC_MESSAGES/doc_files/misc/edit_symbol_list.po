"Clicking the button “Load symbols from equations” enables the **symbol "
"table for editing** while the **correct syntax of the equations** is "
"being checked with the internal function parser. In the case of an error "
"corresponding warnings are given via Windows Message-box dialogs, which "
"are acknowledged, and one has then look for reason behind that error "
"message."

"The symbol table consists of four text columns \"**Symbol**\", "
"\"**Type**\", \"**Unit**\" and \"**Meaning**\"."

"The symbols which were extracted automatically are characterised in the "
"column “Type” as dependent (a) or independent (u) quantities, where the "
"independent ones are listed first. **Only the independent symbols "
"(quantities) are the ones the measurement uncertainties of which are "
"considered by the program. This is the important point which prevents at "
"the very beginning that covariances could otherwise be inferred between "
"dependent symbols because they would share common (independent) "
"symbols.**"

"Within the symbol list, such input quantities for which a mean and its "
"uncertainty are to be derived from a data set, can be marked in the type "
"column with “m“ instead of “a“ (dependent) or “u“ (independent). "
"Furthermore, a quantity, to be derived by an equation, which shall be "
"treated as a parameter without uncertainty, can be defined by sitting its"
" type to “p“."

"The columns “Unit” and “Meaning” are to be completed by the user. "
"However, it is recommended to this later, at least after the equations "
"have got their final state, because subsequent changes in the equations "
"may lead to a different ordering of the symbols. This may also be "
"postponed to a later session."

"Due to subsequent changes within equations it may happen, that some of "
"the symbols do not occur in the present set of equations. Such symbols "
"are listed at the end of the symbol list, where they can be row-wise "
"removed by the user (see below: Notes on editing tables)."

"Most often it is necessary to add manually such symbols at the end of the"
" symbol table which do not explicitly occur in the equations but are "
"needed within those formulae describing standard uncertainties; e.g. "
"counting times tm or t0 are required to calculate the standard "
"uncertainty of gross or background counting rates, sqrt(Rg / tm) or "
"sqrt(R0 / t0), respectively."
