"The feature for non-normal distributed numbers of counts and count rates "
"to be described now refers to Monte Carlo simulations according to ISO "
"11929-2019, part 2. According to part 1 of ISO 11929:2019, the input "
"quantities in any case are assumed as normal-distributed or are "
"attributed to this distribution by the principle of maximum entropy."

"According to the GUM Supplement 1 (JCGM 101:2008), clause 6.4.11, for "
"counted events, which are Poisson distributed and represent an input "
"quantity :math:`X`, e.g., counted photons, the following step is "
"recommended to be taken for determining the distribution of the input "
"quantity. If :math:`\\mathbf{q}` **events** are counted, **a Gamma "
"distribution is assigned to the posterior of the quantity** "
":math:`\\mathbf{X}` by applying the Bayes theorem and using a constant "
"prior. This is to be used as the distribution associated with :math:`X`:"

"In UncertRadio, the described step is treated as follows. As already "
"given by Eq. :eq:`number_count_rates_eq1`, the Gamma distribution is "
"assigned to the number :math:`n` of counts by selecting the distribution "
"type „(N+x) rule“ for :math:`n` (this corresponds to a prior "
":math:`\\rho^{- 1}`). By calculating the corresponding count rate "
":math:`R`, which requires an equation like :math:`R = n/t`, the count "
"rate is also Gamma distributed. This also means, that a count rate to be "
"treated in UncertRadio as Gamma distributed, always requires defining it "
"by an equation like :math:`R = n/t`."
