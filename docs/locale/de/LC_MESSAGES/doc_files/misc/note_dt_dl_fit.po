"The procedure for calculating the Decision threshold and the Detection "
"limit follows ISO 11929:2010. The parameter :math:`a_{1}` is modified by "
"iteration. At first, the parameter :math:`a_{1}` in the above equation "
"(i.e. the value of the Y-90 counting rate in the case of a Y-90 decay-"
"curve) is replaced by an iterated value :math:`a_{1}^{'}` while all other"
" values remain unchanged. From this, new measured net counting rates "
":math:`Y^{'}\\left( t_{k} \\right)` are calculated as well as its new "
"uncertainties :math:`u\\left( Y'\\left( t_{k} \\right) \\right)` (the "
"uncertainty function). With these new values, i.e. (:math:`a_{1}^{'}`,\\ "
":math:`Y^{'}\\left( t_{k} \\right)`,\\ :math:`\\ u\\left( Y'\\left( t_{k}"
" \\right) \\right)`), the least squares analysis calculations are "
"repeated yielding the uncertainty :math:`u\\left( a_{1}^{'} \\right)` of "
"the iterated parameter value :math:`a_{1}^{'}`. With this pair of values "
"(:math:`a_{1}^{'}`,\\ :math:`\\ u\\left( a_{1}^{'} \\right)`) it is then "
"tested whether the termination condition of the iteration procedure is "
"fulfilled; if not, the next iterated value :math:`a_{1}^{''}` is "
"determined and the above procedure is repeated in order to find its "
"uncertainty :math:`u\\left( a_{1}^{''} \\right)`; and so on."
