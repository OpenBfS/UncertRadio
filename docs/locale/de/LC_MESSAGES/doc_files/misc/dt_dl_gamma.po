"These influences usually are not considered in the evaluation model given"

"equation, i.e. calculating the net count rates :math:`R_{ni}^{'}` "
"according to :eq:`eq_gamspk1_2b` to be expected for a given (iterated) "
"value of the activity :math:`A'`, leads directly to the elimination of "
"that “external” influence. Then, from the obtained net counting rates "
":math:`R_{ni}^{'}` single activity values result from :eq:`eq_gamspk1_1` "
"having all the same identical value :math:`A'`, i.e. their spreading is "
"equal to zero!"

"the weighted mean or with the NIST-2004 method is low, at least regarding"
