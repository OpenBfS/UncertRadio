"UncertRadio allows to evaluate several projects in a batch mode. This "
"mode is invoked by the menu item **Edit – Batch evaluation of projects** "
"which opens a dialog, like that one shown in section 5.6. Therein, a "
"simple text file is selected, which contains the project filenames, line "
"by line."

"UncertRadio then starts the calculations, with or without MC simulation, "
"and writes the results into an **output file batch_out.csv** (CSV "
"format). For each evaluated project and each of its up to three output "
"quantities, the filename is written, followed by a table of values for "
"#EG, PE, uPE, BE, uBE, LQ, UQ, sLQ, sUQ, DT, DL. The column headers in "
"the output file indicate their relation to the parts 1 and 2 of ISO "
"11929:2019."

"If MC simulation is selected, it may be recommended to use different "

"unfolding or not, because the MC simulation is much more time consuming "
