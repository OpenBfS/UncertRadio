"It is possible to run the UncertRadio program with adding command line "
"arguments to the calling string. The command line arguments, abbreviated "
"by Arg_n, are strings (without blank characters in them!) which are "
"passed over to UR as a sort of keywords at the starting time and may "
"serve e.g. for passing over the project filename to be processed to UR. "
"Such a call under Windows looks like:"

"The first argument AUTO (capital letters) initiates the batch mode; the "
"second argument is the name of the UR project file to be processed; the "
"third argument is a sort of sample identification number (or a number "
"within an experimental batch) and can e.g. be used to differentiate "
"between such calculation results, which have between obtained for "
"different samples but for different copies of the same master project "
"file in which only a part of input parameters changed from experiment to "
"experiment."

"Since the version 2.04.00 another batch mode is implemented by which a "

"The above argument AUTO is replaced by BATSER, followed by the project "

"temporary modification of the Windows-PATH variable is also applied "
