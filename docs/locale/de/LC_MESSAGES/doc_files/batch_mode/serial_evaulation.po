"The necessity may arise to re-evaluate an existing project for the case "
"of modified values/uncertainties of some of its input quantities. "
"Modified values may result from further measurements; they may also "
"occur, e.g., in an exercise of how the values of the decision threshold "
"of the detection limit depend on some of the input values/uncertainties. "
"Such a procedure is now supported by the menu item „\\ **Edit – Serial "
"evaluation**\\ “."
