"Note: The identification of the net counting rate (more precisely: of the"

"needed to allow within the iteration for the Detection limit a simple "
"numerical inversion of the equations, from the varied output quantity "
"(e.g. activity in Bq/kg wet weight) back to the net counting rate (in "
":math:`s^{- 1}`). The gross count rate symbol must be identified because "
"the user has to supply the uncertainty function for it; for the "
"determination of Decision threshold and Detection limit the value of the "
"gross count rate is varied internally where this uncertainty function is "
"then used to calculate its associated modified uncertainty value."
