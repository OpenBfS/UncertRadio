"After having installed a new program version, there may be a need for "
"checking whether the analytical procedures applied by UncertRadio can be "
"expected to produce evaluation results agreeing with documented results "
"(reference values). Since version 2.3.03 this is possible as described "
"now. An already longer existing (internal) test routine had been used to "
"run the many projects, as given in section 3.3, in a batch processing "
"mode for comparing the results with those documented earlier. This "
"routine, previously with no access by the user, has been extended such "
"that it can be invoked now under the **Menu Options – QC batch test**. It"
" tests the analytical procedures for about 106 projects, which takes a "
"time of about 40 seconds."
