"Usually, coverin=1 is applied when working with a project within "
"UncertRadio by dialog. The value coverin=2 probably will be restricted to"
" the case when UncertRadio used in an automated way from within another "
"program. An Excel application prepares a project file filled with data "
"within Excel and calls UncertRadio for evaluating it. If the input "
"quantity uncertainties had been entered in Excel with coverin=2,and the "
"parameter coverin=2 is given in the project file, UncertRadio converts "
"these uncertainties to k=1 by dividing them by the coverin value. The "
"internal calculations are all done with a coverage factor of 1. Just "
"before the output to an external CSV file, which then will be imported by"
" Excel, UncertRadio multiplies the uncertainty values with the value of "
"the parameter coverf, which also has to be defined in the project file."
