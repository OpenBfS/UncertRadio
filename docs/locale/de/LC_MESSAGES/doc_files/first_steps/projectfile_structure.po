"Knowing the structure of a project file is useful for a semi-automated "
"usage of UncertRadio. For a regularly repeated Sr-89/Sr-90 analysis, "
"e.g., with linear unfolding and a fixed scheme, one will probably be able"
" to establish a basic version of that UncertRadio project file where some"
" parts in it will (nearly) not change. Another part will change, however,"
" from measurement to measurement. The latter data may e.g. be written "
"directly into that file using a small Visual Basic program (MS Excel)."

"those data from the actual measurement are written into that working "
