"The function parser (fparser) implemented in UncertRadio allows to apply "
"**switching variables**, to which **only the two values 0 and 1 can be "
"attributed**. Such a variable allows to **activate another variable b** "
"with **b^1** or **to deactivate it by b^0**. In UncertRadio, these "
"variables can be declared by attaching the string \"Trigger\" to the "
"symbol name. They are, therefore, also called **\"trigger variables\"**."

"Examples are: \"min_Trigger\", \"kilo_Trigger\"; with \"60^min_Trigger\" "
"or with \"1000^kilo_Trigger\" scaling factors of 60 (for minutes) or 1000"
" can be switched; see chapter 2.2.7."

"If a switching variable is to be used for count rate variables, it must "
"contain the part \"Trigger\" attached to e.g. \"min\"; then they can be "
"identified by the program which in turn helps to prevent them from "
"disturbing the process of finding such count rates which directly "
"contribute to the net count rate (see chapter 2.3)."
