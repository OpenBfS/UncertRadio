"The conditional equations defining the model for calculating the value of"
" the **output quantity/quantities y** are written into a text field of "

" may be inferred. The **formula symbols** are extracted automatically "
"from the equations and are transferred into a table where they "
"individually can be complemented by a **unit** and a **meaning**. After "
"input of values and uncertainties of primarily measured quantities a "
"\"Function parser\" is used for interpretation of the equations and "
