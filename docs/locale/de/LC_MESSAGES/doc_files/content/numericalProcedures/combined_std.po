"The combined standard uncertainty :math:`u_{c}(y)` of the output quantity"
" :math:`y` is determined according to ISO GUM (ISO **G**\\ uide on "
"**U**\\ ncertainty of **M**\\ easurement (1995); see also EURACHEM / "
"CITAC Guide \"Quantifying Uncertainty in Analytical Measurement\" (2000))"

"For a type A standard uncertainty of a quantity which must be derived "
"from a set of repeated measurements a necessary small statistical "
"evaluation of mean and standard deviation has to be performed outside "
"this program; only mean and standard deviation will be used in "
"UncertRadio. Usually, with measurements of activities the greater part of"
" uncertainties of quantities belongs to Type B. Within the framework of "
"the **Bayesian theory of measurement** (Weise & Wöger, 1999; Weise et "
"al., 2006) which is underlying the basics of this program an **explicit "
"differentiation between quantities of type A and B is not necessary**. "
"This is also the reason that degrees of freedom are not considered in "
"this program."

"The analytical derivation of formulae for the combined uncertainty for "
"instance of a mass or volume dependent activity using the law of "
"propagating uncertainties may easily yield a certain number of less or "
"more complex formulae the correctness of which is often not easily being "
"controlled. Therefore, a numerical procedure is applied. The first step "
"consists in transferring all quantities/parameters being required for the"
" calculations, these may easily become more than 20, into a program array"
" **MeasdValue(i) = p(i)**. Then, in a subprogram RESULT the value of the "
"output quantity is calculated from the values of the array elements "
"*p(i)* by using the function parser."

"Similarly, the known measurement uncertainties of the individual "
"quantities/parameters are transferred to an array **StdUnc(i) = u(i)**. "
"For the calculation of the combined uncertainty a `subroutine Uncpropa "
"<#URH_UNCPROPA_EN>`__ is used to which the two arrays *p(i)* and *u(i)* "
"are transferred. Covariances are considered in this subroutine. The "
"sensitivity coefficients, i.e. the partial derivates of the function "
"calculated with RESULT with respect to the array elements *p(i)*, are "
"numerically approximated by differential quotients."
