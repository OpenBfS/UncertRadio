"The relation described in the section above, represents the most often "
"encountered case of a **positive linear model**. In this case, the net "
"count rate :math:`R_{n}` increases with an increasing gross count rate. "
"An activity is detected, if the gross count rate is significantly larger "
"than the background count rate."
