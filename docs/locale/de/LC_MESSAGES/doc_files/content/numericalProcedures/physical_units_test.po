"With the program version 2.4.13, UncertRadio contains a menu item which "
"allows as a test to derive **the physical units of dependent variables** "
"based on a numerical algorithm. The units of the input quantities, often "
"given by \"derived units\" are changed to \"basic units\"; in addition to"
" this, the associated scaling factors are determined. If, for example, a "
"counting duration variable was given the unit \"min\", an associated "
"scaling factor of 60 is applied for changing to the basic unit \"s\". The"
" description of basic units and their derived units and of the algorithm "
"for \"calculating\" the units of dependent variables is given in `chapter"
" 7.21 <#treatment-of-physical-units>`__."

"A CSV file distributed with the program contains only a small number of "
"units, which is nearly sufficient for measurements of radioactivity. If "
"necessary, the basic units within the CSV file can be modified by the "
"user."

"By the menu item \"Edit – test physical units\", the transformation to "
"basic units can be tested. In UncertRadio's text editor a comparison of "
"\"original\" and \"converted\" units is shown for the list of quantities "
"(symbols), as well as their associated values and uncertainties. At the "
"begin of this list, a first error message is shown in case of conversion "
"errors found by the program, which can indicate indirectly a wrong "
"combination of units in the indicated number of the equation."

"By programming, the routine behind this menu item was applied to all of "
"UncertRadios example projects. There were indeed errors found, and it was"
" necessary in most of the examples to replace the unit \"1\" of a "
"detection probability by the unit \"1/Bq/s\" in order to get the unit "
"\"Bq\" for an activity as output quantity. More details are given in "
"`chapter 7.21.3 <#invoking-the-test-of-unit-calculations>`__."
