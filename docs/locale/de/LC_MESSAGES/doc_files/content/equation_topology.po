"The equations for calculating the value of the output quantity, as being "
"set up in section 2.2.1, are **hierarchical equations**. They form a list"
" of dependent quantity (of number *nab*), followed by the list of "
"independent input quantities (of number *nmu*). Therefore, numbers from 1"
" to (*nab*\\ +\\ *nmu*) are attributed to the quantities. This list may "
"be considered as if it were a ladder with (*nab*\\ +\\ *nmu*) steps, or a"
" decay scheme of a decaying atomic nucleus; on each step (or level) a "
"quantity symbol resides. According to their associated auxiliary "
"equations, the dependent quantities are related with other symbols on "
"lower positions of the ladder (or level). Connecting these symbols by "
"lines generates a tree structure, which is comparable to a series of "
"allowed level transitions of a decaying atomic nucleus. The series of "
"connecting lines down to the ladder step of an independent input quantity"
" can be compared with a cascade of level transitions of a nucleus ending "
"at the ground state level."

"With taking these additional properties into account (called \"rules\" "
"below), in most cases those symbols can be identified, which represent a "
"count number, including also the associated counting duration. Then, by "
"going one step back within the affected hierarchy ladder, the symbol "

"Knowing the relation between the gross count rate *Rg*, the gross count "
"number *Ng* and the counting duration *tg*, and their symbol numbers "
"within a cascade, allows, for deriving decision threshold and detection "
"limit, to generate a modification from *Rg* to *Rg*\\ ~ from the related "
"modification from *Ng* to *Ng*\\ ~. For simplification of this step, "
"index fields are generated within UncertRadio which point from a count "
"rate to the number of counts and to the counting duration, and vice "
"versa. This, however, requires that not only count rates *Ri* alone are "
"defined in the equations, but also the equations *Ri*/*ti*. This results "
"in the recommendation, to follow this in working with UncertRadio."
