"**UncertRadio** allows for **the evaluation of a measurement in the field"
" of measuring activity** by inserting defining equations the **full "
"calculation of the output quantity and its combined uncertainty "
"(according to ISO GUM)** and to calculate the **values of the Decision "
"threshold and the Detection limit (according to ISO 11929:2019)**, which "
"are closely related to uncertainty."

"The program assumes the **ISO GUM interpretation which is based on the "
"Bayesian theory of the measurement uncertainty (Bayesian statistics)**. "
"The Bayesian measurement uncertainty does not have a statistical "
"uncertainty, nor does it consider degrees of freedom, which makes it "
"different from conventional (frequentist) statistics. Therefore, degrees "
"of freedom need not to be treated in the program."

"One restriction with respect to its usage referred to the circumstance "
"that only those measurement problems could be treated in which the "
"**measurements** of counts or of counting rates **are terminated if the "
"counting time reaches its pre-set value**. The statistically different "
"case where the measurement is terminated by reaching a pre-set value of "
"counts, where the counting time is a random variable, is also treated by "
"the program, since program version 2.4.04 (see section 7.20)."
