"The time behaviour of atom numbers :math:`N_{i}(t)` of the radionuclides "
"(members) of a decay chain is in principle modelled by a system of first "
"order differential equations. They are called the Bateman equations after"
" H. Bateman’s publication of 1910. Their solution led to atom numbers "

"More recent work on improved solutions for such a system applies matrix-"
"based methods, which are applicable in an automated way also for more "
"complex decay chains. The method published by E. Levy in 2019 was chosen "
"for UncertRadio, more specifically the :math:`\\mathbf{F}`-Matrix "
"introduced in chapter 4 of his publication. It was found that the result "
"of a series expansion of an exponential function of a decay matrix as "
"used before lead to a single matrix, the :math:`\\mathbf{F}`-Matrix. In "
"environmental radioactivity mainly the activities of radionuclides are of"
" interest instead of their atom numbers. The general relation "
":math:`A_{i} = \\lambda_{i} \\cdot N_{i}` between activity and atom "
"numbers allows to derive an :math:`\\mathbf{F}`-Matrix for activities. "
"The rank of the matrix is equal to the number of members of decay chain, "
"denoted as :math:`L.` In his chapter 4, Levy derived an algorithm for "
"calculating the elements of the matrix :math:`\\mathbf{F}`, which is of "
"left-triangular shape. An important feature of :math:`\\mathbf{F}` is "
"that it holds only for the given time :math:`t`; for any other time "
"value, :math:`\\mathbf{F}` always has to be re-computed."
