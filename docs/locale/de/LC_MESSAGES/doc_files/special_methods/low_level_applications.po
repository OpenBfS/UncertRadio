"Very low numbers of counts N are Poisson-distributed instead of Gaussian-"
"distributed. Using Bayesian methods it can be shown that counting rates "
"derived from them then are Gamma-distributed. Taking a prior assumed as "
"uniform (Weise et al., 2009) results in an expected value of the counting"
" rate :math:`R\\ `\\ which is characterized by :math:`\\widehat{R} = (N +"
" x)/t_{m}\\ `\\ with a value of :math:`u^{2}\\left( \\widehat{R} \\right)"
" = (N + x)/(t_{m}^{2}\\ ) = \\widehat{R}/t_{m}\\ `\\ for its variance. "
"From this the recommendation follows, for the case of very low counting "
"numbers, to replace :math:`N` by\\ :math:`\\ N + x`, **being designated "
"as the** :math:`\\left( \\mathbf{N + x} \\right)` **Rule here** which is "
