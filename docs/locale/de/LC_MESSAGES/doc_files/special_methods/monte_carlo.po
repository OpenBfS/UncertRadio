"The simulation is done for a chosen (large) number of simulations of the "
"measurement. For this purpose, for each of those quantities having been "
"defined in the symbol list under the TAB “Equations” and characterized "
"there as independent (u) input quantities, simulated input values are "
"taken from their correspondent distributions (normal, rectangular or "
"triangular distributions). The underlying individual distributions have "
"been determined under the TAB “Values, uncertainties”. If the :ref:`low-"
"level applications, (n+x)-rule` has been selected there for counting "
"numbers, their associated values are MC sampled according to a Gamma "
"distribution; the values of the counting rates derived from the counting "
"numbers then are also Gamma distributed. If all these input quantities "
"have got a simulated value, a value of the output quantity - “the first "
"simulated value of **y**\\ ” - is calculated according to the equations "
"already defined."

"**Important note on this issue**: Since the UncertRadio version 0.05 "
"(2007/11) this method of producing correlated variables was completely "
"adapted to methods described in textbooks where matrix methods are used "

"Brandt, Datenanalyse; V. Blobel and E. Lohrmann, Statistische und "
"numerische Methoden der Datenanalyse; as well as the Draft of the new "
"Supplement 1 of ISO GUM). This can be proven by trying the UncertRadio "
"example project files **Kessel-2a-2006.txp and Kessel-2b-2006.txp** from "
"the recent publication by Kessel et al. (2006) (see also: :ref:`Meaning "

" that the uncertainties of the :math:`x_{i}` should be small. In this "
"case, the probability density functions :math:`\\varphi_{i}\\left( x_{i} "

":math:`F\\left( x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n} \\right)` of the output "
