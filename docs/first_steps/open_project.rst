Viewing an existing project
---------------------------

To become acquainted with the functioning of the program it is
recommended to look into existing example projects. The sequence of
steps and the buttons and tabs to be clicked as shown below is nearly
the same when creating a new project.

**User guidance is presented in the last field of the status bar at the
bottom of the UncertRadio window.**

   • File - Load Project |document-open.png| : Load an existing project
   file (extensions txp or csv) of a measurement problem into the
   program, whereby all calculations are done and, finally, the TAB
   "Results" becomes visible.

   • select TAB "Procedure" for comments on that procedure

   • select TAB "Equations"

   • click button "Load symbols from equations"

   • click button "Load symbols from finalized symbol table"

-  click button "Accept all" -> this enables the TAB "Values,
      Uncertainties"

   • look at the equations and the table of symbols

   • select TAB "Values, uncertainties"

   • click Button "Calculation of uncertainties" -> this enables the TAB
   "Uncertainty budget"

   • look at details in the uncertainty table

   • select TAB "Uncertainty budget" showing the uncertainty budget of
   the output quantity

   • select TAB "Results" showing all results including Decision
   threshold and Detection limit

   • a Monte Carlo simulation of the calculations as an alternative
   method may be started by clicking the button TAB "Start"

   • Closing the project file |image16|, loading the next project (see
   above), or terminating the program: File – Quit program.

   **Note regarding safety:**

   If one has changed values while going through the different parts of
   the program, one should NOT save the project when the program asks
   for it, because otherwise the project file would be modified.

Scrolling within tables or in the equations field is possible with the
mouse wheel after clicking within that table of field.
