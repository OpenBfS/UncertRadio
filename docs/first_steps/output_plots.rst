Graphics window
---------------

Graphical representations are now displayed in a window containing three
Tabs for applications:

-  Monte Carlo-Simulation (TAB MC),

-  an application not yet â€žgiven free" (TAB MCMC) and

-  a graphic related to linear unfolding displaying measured values,
   standard uncertainties and the fitting curve (TAB LFIT).

The associated graphical representations are saved as PNG files:

-  MCplotfile.png

-  CurvePlot.png

The button "Copy" allows to save the graphic as a file in a format which
has been selected with the combobox, where the user is asked for the
filename.

This window can be closed with the button "Close" at the end of the
window.

The graphic associated with the TAB LFit can be invoked by the icon
|FittingResults_24| in the toolbar.
